# TensorFlow-Advanced-Techniques-Specialization
1) Understand the underlying basis of the Functional API and build exotic non-sequential model types, custom loss functions, and layers.  

2) Learn optimization and how to use GradientTape & Autograph, optimize training in different environments with multiple processors and chip types.  

3) Practice object detection, image segmentation, and visual interpretation of convolutions.  

4) Explore generative deep learning, and how AIs can create new content, from Style Transfer through Auto Encoding and VAEs to GANs.
